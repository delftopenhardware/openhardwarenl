The third edition of the [open science festival](https://opensciencefestival.nl) is scheduled to take place on the 31st of August at Erasmus university Rotterdam.

We have three avenues for submitting proposals (by 15th May), we can do a "Workshop" (what delft open hardware did in 2021), we can organize a "Session", get a booth at the "Marketplace". Of the three, marketplace seems to be the best fit in terms of having reach and getting a lot of eyeballs. It will allow us to set up a space explaining things about open hardware, display some projects and get people to be involved with what we are doing.


The two main questions that need to be answered for the proposal

What we want to do at the event, three options?

    1. Organise a Workshop of 2x 45 mins with break
    2. Organise a Session of 45 mins
    3. Present an initiative with a clear link to Open Science at the Market Place

Write a 250/500 words (base on our choise to the pervious question) summary explaining what the we are going to be doing.


Proposals so far on what we would liket to submit (based on meeting of DOH, preliminary notes h/t Jose)

#### 1. How Universities can support open hardware science spinnoffs: Open Hardware in practice from master thesis to RHE.

    Tell the story of how you go from doing a master thesis working already in an open source ethos (precious plastics background), then moving on to having a backup by the University to be able to spend time on this project, which have allowed Jerry to develop further Tech leadership skills in an open source approach and provide new knowledge application opportunities for students from different disciplines: machine learning, software engineering, applied physics... I would emphasize those aspects that show case how the University produces a spinoof that contributes back to the education system by providing new real opportunities to contribute to projects that aim to solve real problems, how also.
    
Maybe Siemens would like to join:
    
#### 2. Market place showcasing dutch open hardware products incubated at the University.**'
    Todo: Make a call for people in the netherlands to join the market place...
        - Vit microscopes
        - Martin Klomp
        - Plastic Scanner
        - Siemen....
    
#### 2.1. Market Place combine the above with a plan
    
    
    ##### Open Hardware in the Netherlands – a University Perspective
    The open hardware marketplace at the open science festival hopes to share with the participants, some of the activities of the Open Hardware community in the Netherlands. This is a joint marketplace hosted by members of the open hardware communities from TU Delft, Utrecht University and Wageningen University. 
    Open hardware is a crucial component for a comprehensive open science ecosystem and we are looking to showcase some of the achievements of this community over the past few years, along with a call for participation. In this regard the market place will feature a display of some of the projects that have originated from the open hardware communities from the three universities, including,
    1.	Plastic scanner – Jerry, TU Delft (winner of the Dyson Innovation award)
    2.	Open source microscope – Vit, Wageningen University
    3.	Recylable Solar Panels from BioSphere Solar –Siemen -  A start up from students and community members from TU Delft
    4.	Open Source Flow batteries – Sanli, Utrecht University
    5.	More based on display space available.
    We will also be featuring open source course material from the Open Hardware Academy that was implemented for the first time last year and which is now available for everyone to use online. Successful projects that came out of this course including, 
    1.	Worm bin – Vincent
    2.	Easily accessible music player for those with Neuro-degenerative diseases – Nemo
    3.	Bicycle theft detection – Nanami
    We hope these examples will foster greater participation and involvement in Open Hardware from members of the open science community from around the Netherlands.  

    
    
#### 3 Session on OH Academy
    - Introduce what we did last year, show the materials, how to show the materials... Explain the philosophy of the material.....
    - Academic year September...
    - Ideas for the future...
    
#### 4 Workshop National challenge
    - One aspect of a challenge of FAIR battery
    - NOIH challenge, 
    - Competion FLOW batteries
    
    How would a national challenge look like:
            - Interactive: Workshop designing a national challenge open hardware
            - Invite participants
            - Test the idea of a National Challenge...

#### 5 How to foster an open hardware community
    
    
#### 6 Workshop paper signals
    Branded as reproducibility
