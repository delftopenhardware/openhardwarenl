The third edition of the [open science festival](https://opensciencefestival.nl) is scheduled to take place on the 31st of August at Erasmus university Rotterdam.

We have three avenues for submitting proposals (by 15th May), we can do a "Workshop" (what delft open hardware did in 2021), we can organize a "Session", get a booth at the "Marketplace". Of the three, marketplace seems to be the best fit in terms of having reach and getting a lot of eyeballs. It will allow us to set up a space explaining things about open hardware, display some projects and get people to be involved with what we are doing.
