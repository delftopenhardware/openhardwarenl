The third edition of the [open science festival](https://opensciencefestival.nl) is scheduled to take place on the 31st of August at Erasmus university Rotterdam.

We have three avenues for submitting proposals (by 15th May), we can do a "Workshop" (what delft open hardware did in 2021), we can organize a "Session", get a booth at the "Marketplace". Of the three, marketplace seems to be the best fit in terms of having reach and getting a lot of eyeballs. It will allow us to set up a space explaining things about open hardware, display some projects and get people to be involved with what we are doing.


The two main questions that need to be answered for the proposal

What we want to do at the event, three options?

    1. Organise a Workshop of 2x 45 mins with break
    2. Organise a Session of 45 mins
    3. Present an initiative with a clear link to Open Science at the Market Place

Write a 250/500 words (base on our choise to the pervious question) summary explaining what the we are going to be doing.
